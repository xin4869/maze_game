# maze_game
## python program
> This is a python program completed in course programming Y1.
* The maze is built using random numbers.
* The player (' P ') starts from the top left corner and the exit (' E ') is at the bottom right corner.
* The program asks the user for an input which tells the direction in which the player wants to move ('w' up, 'd' right, 's' down or 'a' left), until the player reaches the exit.
* The player loses a point for each step, but can gain more points by finding treasures in the maze.
